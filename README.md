# mock_vita_2_results_scraped
This repo is a web scraper which downloads the results of TCS Mock vita for analysis purposes.

How to use ?


First of all, verify whether or not the required packages are installed on your computer. You may use "installations.txt" file 
which is included in the repo to do that.

Having that done, the very next step would be straight away running "tcs_mockVita_2_result.py" and watch out for the magic.This
script automatically downloads the TCS mockvita result and writes that into "tcs_mock_vita_2_results.csv".


Now that your required csv file is downloaded you may use that for analysis purposes.
